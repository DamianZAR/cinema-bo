I like to watch movies in theaters, and how each movie generate incomes as the days go by. So I used data from Box Office Mojo and The Numbers, two web pages dedicated to movies data, to do charts about the incomes of the seven highest grossing movies of the first semester of 2021.
The charts are in my instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/p/CRSFVG8lRVG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

The cvs files of the seven movies are in my kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/damizar/movies-with-highest-grossing-20211
